Once again we just didn't get around to writing a Christmas letter in either 2019 or 2020, so we decided to send out a Pascha Letter.  Pascha is the ancient Christian term for Easter, linking the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus to its precursor, the Jewish Passover.  But even though we had an additional 5 weeks after western Easter to prepare, we still didn't get the letter written on time to print it, so here it is online!

Its been a big couple of years for all of us, for sure.  Because we can't keep straight what happened when, we offer here event highlights organized by subject matter.

## Dancing

Can you dance during a pandemic?  Well, sure!  Even though planned competitions were on hold, Jan did keep dancing, first with virtual sessions online and then in person with masks and other precautions. It was also possible to submit taped performances to a couple of virtual events, which kept the flame of competition alive. Soon we will be attending Jan's first live event in almost two years, and after neck fusion in August 2019 and lumbar fusion in August 2020, she is looking forward to getting moving again.

## Flying

Flying, too, has been limited but not gone from our lives.  Mitch is now a part owner, with three other pilots, of two airplanes (So he owns...half a plane?) He has been able to serve folks in need of medical transportation with Angel Flights, has taken friends for much-needed breaks on day trips, and flown several trips to the Aidrondacks to hike and ski. He also is Jan's private transport service to her new job in Pennsylavania (more on this later.)

## Printing
The good news about CatPrint is that in February 2020 we took possession of our very own facility, with over double the space of our previous quarters. The bad news is that in March 2020, sales plummeted to less than half of our pre-pandemic volume, and have remained very low for the last year.  Consequently we were forced to put over half our faithful employees on furlough. We are slowly rebuilding both our sales and our team.  Due to the hard work and dedication of our remaining employees, we have kept our spirits up and the company afloat.  Thanks to God for all things.

## Traveling

Travelling?  What's THAT?  Well, since it's been over two years since we have communicated, we can talk about 2019, which featured quite a bit of travel.  We had two highly enjoyable outings with our long-standing friends Dave and Kathy Lester, first to the Shaw Festival in June 2019, and then to New Orleans for New Year's 2020.  Jan cruised down the Elbe river with another long-standing friend, Cindy Politowicz, and we went to a lovely Mackinac Island wedding for Jan's second cousins Liam and Kristy Moll.  Liam is the son of Jan's cousin Leslie Moll. Finally we went to Seattle to see son Bill, daughter-in-law Shana and grandson Luca - and the Rolling Stones! And since then it's been to the cabin, and ....to the cabin. Work travel for Jan involves a once a month trip to Scranton PA, but that's not for fun so it doesn't count.  But soon!  We will begin to see the world again.

## Building
Buidling efforts have centered on our cabin in the Adirondacks.  Since we knew that many in our family would want to be there more during winter 2020, we started with a big upgrade to our driveway.  Until now this has been impassable during the winter months, requiring snowshoes to access the place.  We are also doing site work in preparation for a big expansion project in winter 2021.  The site work has been quite exciting, involving big (BIG) machinery and three days of blasting.  Yes, you read that right - BLASTING.  Huge drills, actual dynamite, ignition switches, fuses and explosions.  The explosions are damped by enormous rubber mats, but still there are big booms and flying dirt.  Exciting is definitely the word.

## Hiking
Mitch has started hiking again in a big way.  Years ago we both started the journey to being "Adirondack 46'ers," people who have hiked up all the mountains in New York which are over 4,000 feet high. (Note: four of these actually aren't over 4,000 feet due to surveying errors, but you still climb them.) What with kids, work, and other life events, it's been years since any mountains were climbed.  This past year Mitch restarted this quest, and has now been up over half of these peaks.  He also climbed nine smaller mountains this winter- yes in the winter! - to become a Lake Placid Niner.  Coffee the dog has been a good companion on these outings, and even has his own backpack now.

## Serving
In addition to Angel Flight service, Mitch is Vice President of our parish, and serves on the St. Tikhon's Seminary Board of Trustees.  Our company CatPrint is involved in several avenues of service, including being a corporate sponsor of RESOLVE of Rochester, taking the Polar Plunge every year to support Special Olympics (exept this year of course, but we'll get chilled next year) and supporting the Epilepsy Foundation's Chocolate Ball.  Jan took over as volunteer CFO at St. Tikhon's Seminary in late 2018 when the previous CFO had a medical emergency, and as of July 2020 was hired to fill this position for the next three years. She also is treasurer for the OCA Diocese of New York and New Jersey.  


## Arrivals and Departures

Departures: Sadly, death has claimed a number of our loved ones in the past two years.  Brian Bueche, one of our groomsmen and a hiking buddy of Mitch's since 1976, succumbed to a sudden heart attack in December 2019.  Jan's beloved cousin Mike Janik, after successful lung transplant surgery in late 2019, contracted an infection and passed away in August 2020. Two young men, children of families close to our hearts, died in their 20's these past two years.  And last, our sweet dog Lily, companion of over 12 years, had to be euthanized in September 2020 following a cancer diagnosis. We miss all these dear ones and commend them to the Lord, whose Resurrection we are celebrating.

Arrivals: Joyfully, we continue to expand our family of godchildren and grand godchildren. We have welcomed Adam Shellard, Christopher Jones,  and Connor and Jovi DeFehr to our faith family.  Additionally, our godchildren Joe and Kelly Kirtland welcomed daughter Maggie in April 2019 (she is almost TWO). We are blessed beyond measure by the presence of all these wonderful young people in our lives. 
Additionally (yes, pun intended, sorry) our CatPrint family has been expanded by the addition of four new Kitten Printers in the past two years.  We can't wait to have a company get-together with all these little ones.  


## Congratulations
We ask you to join us in congratulating our family on their many accomplishments. Otherwise known as bragging on the kids. We are proud of them!

Congratulations are first in order for our youngest family member, Luca, who started kindergarten this year.  It's been a weird way to start school but he is doing well.

BIG congratulations to daughter-in-law Audrey - graduating from Fordham Law School with high honors, and passing the New York Sate Bar exam on her first sitting.  Wow.  She now works at a major law firm in NYC.

Congratulations to son Paul, (Audrey's husband) on his new position at Google as a Drive Frontend Software Engineer. Last time we wrote a newsletter, he was still commuting to Boston for work.  Now he and Audrey are Manhattanites, living on 48th Street in the middle of the city.  They look forward to more big city life as the pandemic eases.

Congratulations to daughter-in-law Terry on her new position at Kickstarter as a Senior Product Manager. Despite its national reputation Kickstarter is actually a pretty small company, and Terry is enjoying the work and the company very much.

Congratulations to son Isaac, (Terry's husband) on his promotion to Staff User Experience Manager at Google.  He manages a couple of different teams on two coasts who design how the world experiences Google. His previously heavy travel schedule of over six months per year was eliminated in 2020, one good side effect of COVID.

Also congratulations to Paul and Isaac as founding members and managers of one of the largest and highly rated gaming clubs in NYC - The Carcosa Club - with a several year waiting list just to get in.

Many congratulations to our son Bill for starting his own metalworking business, Seiji Fabrications, in 2019, and keeping it afloat and growing during the last two years. 

And finally, congratulations to Matt Bueche, who married the beautiful and talented Nora in October 2020, and to godson Adam Shellard on his May 2020 marriage to Michelle, soon to be a family medicine doctor here in Rochester.  Both were lovely outdoor occasions which brought much joy to all participants. 

We thank God for each of you being in our lives.  Please accept our heartfelt thanks to ALL of you for your friendship, prayers, and support during the tough times, and for sharing with us in the good times. With much love we say - Christ is Risen!  Indeed He is Risen!

Mitch and Jan

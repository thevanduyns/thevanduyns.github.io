It's been a while since our Pascha letter, and Here we are another year gone by, and all in all its been a great, action packed year.

## Q1

Mitch started the New Year's right by getting up at about 4:00 AM and hiking Pitchoff Mountain - a 1300 foot climb, to meet the Sunrise over the Adirondack high peaks. Jan stayed home and in bed.

In February,  Mitch completed his 50th Angel Flight mission, and completed the Lake Placid 9'er Winter challenge.  Nine mountains in winter....

Meanwhile Jan slogged along trying to get the St. Tikhon's Seminary accounts in order.  It's a een a challenge as the previous CFO had a stroke leaving lots of unknowns, and the Seminary board decided to put a new and very difficult to fundraising and accounting system in place.  Ugh!

## Q2

A *friend* (um.. define friend) of Mitch's referred him to a company in the UK working hard to develop tools to get our planetary problems such as global climate change and human exploitation under control.  They desperately needed a Chief Technical Officer to guide them, so back to work he went.  If you want to read a really scary book (with a happy ending) on the subject checkout *Ministry For The Future* by Kim Stanley Robinson.

Jan had a Dance Comp in Orlando, where she won the Pro-Am Scholarship and also took **Top Student**.  Not bad at all.  Mitch flew down for the last day and the awards, then whisked us off to  Harbor Island in the Bahamas.  Pink sand beaches and lots of chickens....What a great trip!

Mitch bagged a couple more of the Adirondack 46 mountains, with Paul along for the trip up TableTop mountain.

Bill Hicks continued to turn out beautiful pieces of metal work - stairs, railings and fences and the like from his studio in Seattle.

## Q3

Meanwhile CatPrint returns to profitability, and by the end of Q3 we were breaking sales records month after month. We have a dedicated, talented team who keep our customers happy and our presses rolling.  If you did not print your Christmas card with CatPrint, we wonder...why not?

Jan competed in an even bigger Dance Competition in Florida and came away with another stack of medals.  

Mitch, Paul and Jan attended a one year memorial service in August for Jan's cousin Mike, who left us last August due to complications of a lung transplant.  We miss him very much, but were pleased to spend time with Jan's brother and sister-in-law, cousins and friends of the family.

This was and was a tremendous slog and fun time, all in one. 

Matt Bueche (son of Mitch's great friend Brian of blessed memory) and his bride Honora Fallon-Oben finally got to have a proper wedding and reception. They were officially married in 2020 at the height of COVID, but now we had THE PARTY.  It was a grand celebration, and good to be back with all the Bueches. We did miss Brian.

Daughter Audrey was recruited by her former boss to join him at a new firm in NYC - what a compliment!  A tribute to her hard work and great accomplishments.  We are so proud of her.  [Audrey VanDuyn](https://www.bakermckenzie.com/en/people/v/van-duyn-audrey)

On a trip to NYC we visited the Carcosa gaming club, a huge 4000 sq foot operation in Brooklyn founded by Isaac, Paul and their friends.  It is the largest and most highly rated of its kind in the NYC area, with a massive waiting list of gamers trying to join. How these guys do this and continue to excel at Google is beyond us. We are bewildered and proud.  [The Carcosa Club](https://www.carcosaclub.com/)

## Q4 (or the biggest 3 months EVER)

First big thing: those of you that know us well will almost certainly laugh but... we bought and moved into (yet another) house - still in the greater Rochester area. Don't say anything... no really, just don't.  We know we're silly.

Why?  Our old house was great but at 120 years and counting, maintenance was getting to be a hobby, it was three floors to climb up and down, and it was 25 minutes to CatPrint.  Many may laugh at 25 minutes but we are more used to...five? Also the neighborhood while friendly and vibrant featured lots of college students and had an uncertain future. Our new neighborhood is quieter and more stable.

And Why Not?  After 42 years of marriage we finally found a house that we both simply adore.  All on one floor, big enough that Mitch doesn't bump his head or feel cramped, but cozy enough for Jan's cottage sensibilities.  Its a lovely 1968 U-Shaped ranch with a pool in the center court yard.  It's been beautifully upgraded into a modern but still classic house.

Please come and visit!  With five bedrooms and five bathrooms, our motto of "There's always room for one more" has been given new scope.

And thanks to our good friend and frequent realtor Susan Glenz, we were able to sell the old house, quick, smart and for a great price.  

Second big thing: During October we welcomed a new Boxer dog into our home. Pretty Girl is a sweet 8 year old lady who comes to us from an Amish puppy mill. She is a fine companion for our other Boxer Coffee.

Third big thing: Mitch flew us to Detroit, where we stayed with our dear friends Dave and Kathy Lester and went to probably the last Rolling Stones concert of... ever.  And Mitch finally got to have dinner at Joe Muer's Restaurant, which Jan has been telling him about for almost 50 years. With a century long reputation, this place kept John Kennedy waiting in line....but we got a reservation!

Fourth big thing: the new house was perfect for a vast Thanksgiving gathering, which included sons Isaac and Paul, Daughter in Law Terry, (Audrey would have loved to come but sadly could not make it), godson Stefan Cobeli, godchildren Joe and Kelly Kirtland and their wonderful young'uns Teddy and Maggie, and Terry's parents Ruth and Jerry Callan.  Not only did we have a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner, but the pool stayed open and warm, so we could swim in the snowfall.

And to finish up November in style (fifth big thing) Jan and Mitch both came down with COVID.  Not life threatening, just exhausting.  We seem to be over it except for a lingering cough and the exhaustion, and thankfully nobody seemed to pick it up from us.  Where did we get it?  Mitch blames a local dance competition, but Jan blames the Stones. (See 'Blame It On the Stones' by Kris Kristoffersen.)

Sixth big thing: Mitch's consulting gig in the UK had a rollout of an application aiming to help British local governments map out their journey to carbon neutrality.  Over 400 government agencies attended (!), and the software was well received, but Mitch, working through COVID, was...wait for it... exhausted.

Last big thing: Mitch's aircraft partnership put their beloved Diamond 42 on the block, as everyone is ready to move up to a bigger, faster plane.  So we may be buying an airplane all our own.  There's an old Tom T. Hall song that we love, called "Faster Horses, Younger Women, Older Whiskey, More Money." Mitch's version seems to be "Faster Airplanes..." Not sure where the younger women come in.  

We are looking forward to another big Christmas celebration for 10+ people, and a New Year's carol singing party to which ALL OF YOU are invited.  God grant us peace, health and the love of family and friends in 2022. God bless each of you in the New Year.

----------------------------------------

It has been a big couple of years for all of us, for sure.  Because we can't keep straight what happened when, we offer here event highlights organized by subject matter.


<img align="left" width="30%" src="/images/dance-shot.jpg" class="image-left">

## Dancing

Can you dance during a pandemic?  Well, sure!  Even though planned competitions were on hold, Jan did keep dancing, first with virtual sessions online and then in person with masks and other precautions. It was also possible to submit taped performances to a couple of virtual events, which kept the flame of competition alive. Soon we will be attending Jan's first live event in almost two years, and after neck fusion in August 2019 and lumbar fusion in August 2020, she is looking forward to getting moving again.  

<img align="left" width="30%" src="/images/IMG_0136.jpg" class="image-left">

## Flying

Mitch is now a part owner, with three other pilots, of two airplanes (So he owns...half a plane?) and he got his multi-engine rating back at the end of 2019.  During COVID he has been able to continue to serve folks in need of medical transportation with Angel Flights, and has now completed over 50 Angel Flight missions.  Also he has taken family and friends for much-needed breaks on day trips, and flown several trips to the Adirondacks to hike and ski. He also is Jan's private transport service to her new job in Pennsylavania, and to meetings in NYC (more on this later.)

## Printing

The good news about CatPrint is that in February 2020 we took possession of our very own 20,000 sq. ft. facility, with over double the space of our previous quarters. The bad news is that in March 2020, sales plummeted to less than half of our pre-pandemic volume, and have remained very low for the last year.  Consequently we were forced to put over half our faithful employees on furlough. We are slowly rebuilding both our sales and our team.  Due to the hard work and dedication of our remaining employees, we have kept our spirits up and the company afloat.  Thanks to God for all things.

By the way we hope to see more of your Christmas Cards and Invitations printed by CatPrint.  Visit our website [www.catprint.com](https://www.catprint.com) today, and if you would like a "Family and Friends" discount just let us know.  We are proud that we are the highest rated online print company in the world.

## Traveling

Travelling?  What's THAT?  Well, since it's been over two years since we have communicated, we can talk about 2019, which featured quite a bit of travel.  We had two highly enjoyable outings with our long-standing friends Dave and Kathy Lester, first to the Shaw Festival in June 2019, and then to New Orleans for New Year's 2020.  Jan cruised down the Elbe river with another long-standing friend, Cindy Politowicz, and we went to a lovely Mackinac Island wedding for Jan's second cousins Liam and Kristy Moll.  Liam is the son of Jan's cousin Leslie Moll. Finally we went to Seattle to see son Bill, daughter-in-law Shana and grandson Luca - and the Rolling Stones! And since then it's been to the cabin, and ....to the cabin. Work travel for Jan involves a once a month trip to Scranton PA, but that's not for fun so it doesn't count.  But soon!  We will begin to see the world again.

<img align="left" width="40%" src="/images/blasting-action.gif" class="image-left">

## Building
Buidling efforts have centered on our cabin in the Adirondacks.  Since we knew that many in our family would want to be there more during winter 2020, we started with a big upgrade to our driveway.  Until now this has been impassable during the winter months, requiring snowshoes to access the place.  We are also doing site work in preparation for a big expansion project in winter 2021.  The site work has been quite exciting, involving big (BIG) machinery and three days of blasting.  Yes, you read that right - BLASTING.  Huge drills, actual dynamite, ignition switches, fuses and explosions.  The explosions are damped by enormous rubber mats, but still there are big booms and flying dirt.  Exciting is definitely the word.  

<img align="right" width="40%" src="/images/hiking.jpg" class="image-right">

## Hiking
Mitch has started hiking again in a big way.  Years ago we both started the journey to being "Adirondack 46'ers," people who have hiked up 46 highest peaks in NY.  What with kids, work, and other life events, it's been years since any mountains were climbed.  This past year Mitch restarted this quest, and has now been up over half of these peaks.  He also climbed nine smaller mountains this winter - yes in the winter! - to become a Winter Lake Placid Niner.  Coffee the dog has been a good companion on many of these outings, and even has his own backpack now.

## Serving
In addition to being an Angel Flight pilot, Mitch is Vice President of our parish, and serves on the St. Tikhon's Seminary Board of Trustees.  Our company CatPrint is involved in several avenues of service, including being a corporate sponsor of RESOLVE of Rochester, taking the Polar Plunge every year to support Special Olympics (exept this year of course, but we'll get chilled next year) and supporting the Epilepsy Foundation's Chocolate Ball.  Jan took over as volunteer CFO at St. Tikhon's Seminary in late 2018 when the previous CFO had a medical emergency, and as of July 2020 was hired to fill this position for the next three years. She also is treasurer for the OCA Diocese of New York and New Jersey.  


## Arrivals and Departures

Departures: Sadly, death has claimed a number of our loved ones in the past two years.  Brian Bueche, one of our groomsmen and a hiking buddy of Mitch's since 1976, succumbed to a sudden heart attack in December 2019.  Jan's beloved cousin Mike Janik, after successful lung transplant surgery in late 2019, contracted an infection and passed away in August 2020. Two young men, children of families close to our hearts, died in their 20's these past two years.  And last, our sweet dog Lily, companion of over 12 years, had to be euthanized in September 2020 following a cancer diagnosis. We miss all these dear ones and commend them to the Lord, whose Resurrection we are celebrating.

Arrivals: Joyfully, we continue to expand our family of godchildren and grand godchildren. We have welcomed Adam Shellard, Christopher Jones,  and Connor and Jovi DeFehr to our faith family.  Additionally, our godchildren Joe and Kelly Kirtland welcomed daughter Maggie in April 2019 (she is almost TWO). We are blessed beyond measure by the presence of all these wonderful young people in our lives.
Additionally (yes, pun intended, sorry) our CatPrint family has been expanded by the addition of four new Kitten Printers in the past two years.  We can't wait to have a company get-together with all these little ones.  


## Congratulations
We ask you to join us in congratulating our family on their many accomplishments. Otherwise known as bragging on the kids. We are proud of them!

Congratulations are first in order for our youngest family member, Luca, who started kindergarten this year.  It's been a weird way to start school but he is doing well.

BIG congratulations to daughter-in-law Audrey - graduating from Fordham Law School with high honors, and passing the New York Sate Bar exam on her first sitting.  Wow.  She now works at a major law firm in NYC.

Congratulations to son Paul, (Audrey's husband) on his new position at Google as a Drive Frontend Software Engineer. Last time we wrote a newsletter, he was still commuting to Boston for work.  Now he and Audrey are Manhattanites, living on 48th Street in the middle of the city.  They look forward to more big city life as the pandemic eases.

Congratulations to daughter-in-law Terry on her new position at Kickstarter as a Senior Product Manager. Despite its national reputation Kickstarter is actually a pretty small company, and Terry is enjoying the work and the company very much.

Congratulations to son Isaac, (Terry's husband) on his promotion to Staff User Experience Manager at Google.  He manages a couple of different teams on two coasts who design how the world experiences Google. His previously heavy travel schedule of over six months per year was eliminated in 2020, one good side effect of COVID.

Also congratulations to Paul and Isaac as founding members and officers of one of the largest and highly rated gaming clubs in NYC - The Carcosa Club - with a several year waiting list just to get in. [The Carcosa Club](https://www.carcosaclub.com/)

Many congratulations to our son Bill for starting his own metalworking business, Seiji Fabrications, in 2019, and keeping it afloat and growing during the last two years.

And finally, congratulations to Matt Bueche, who married the beautiful and talented Nora in October 2020, and to godson Adam Shellard on his May 2020 marriage to Michelle, soon to be a family medicine doctor here in Rochester.  Both were lovely outdoor occasions which brought much joy to all participants.

We thank God for each of you being in our lives.  Please accept our heartfelt thanks to ALL of you for your friendship, prayers, and support during the tough times, and for sharing with us in the good times. With much love we say - Christ is Risen!  Indeed He is Risen!

Mitch and Jan
